## Summary

Cam Linke, the CEO of the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), and Joshua Pantony, the CEO of boosted.ai, jointly explored how AI will transform organizational structure, workflows, and the nature of work itself ([Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute][1], [boosted.ai][2]). They projected that small, cross-functional teams of around 20 people augmented by AI tools could match the output of traditional departments of 200, reshaping the scale at which businesses operate ([McKinsey & Company][3]). Rather than eliminating human roles, AI was framed as following a sigmoid-curve trajectory: steadily augmenting human judgment and creativity but never fully replacing the uniquely human capacity for critical thinking and empathy ([McKinsey & Company][4]).

## Key Insights

### Exponential Productivity Gains

* **Lean Teams, High Throughput:** By automating routine coding tasks, test generation, and documentation, a 20-person unit could achieve the equivalent output of a 200-person group ([McKinsey & Company][3]).
* **10× Ambition:** Both leaders urged thinking in orders of magnitude aiming for tenfold improvements through AI, rather than incremental 10% gains ([McKinsey & Company][5]).

### Human + AI Synergy

* **Augmentation Over Replacement:** AI excels at covering edge-case scenarios and accelerating iterative tasks, but human oversight remains essential for maintaining deep thought processes like testing and design reviews ([McKinsey & Company][3]).
* **Specialist vs. Generalist:** Future professionals will need T-shaped skill sets specialized technical expertise plus broad interpersonal and creative abilities ([Investopedia][6]).
* **Liberal Arts Renaissance:** As AI automates up to 60% of routine activities in many occupations, soft skills: communication, ethics, storytelling, will become critical differentiators ([McKinsey & Company][3]).

### Workforce Transformation

* **Surface Areas of Impact:** AI will redefine job functions end-to-end—from sourcing candidates via continuous A/B testing of job postings to personal AI tutors that deliver customized learning from primary school onward ([McKinsey & Company][5]).
* **Job Disruption, Not Loss:** While generative AI could automate up to 30% of work hours by 2030, historical evidence suggests net employment will stabilize as new roles emerge alongside technology ([McKinsey & Company][4]).

### Practical AI Toolchain

* **Developer Ecosystem:** Tools like Claude for rapid UI mockups, Replay for code playback, Cursor for internal knowledge search, and ChatGPT for design assets can boost individual developer productivity by up to 5×, even outpacing many seasoned engineers ([WSJ][7]).
* **Experimentation & Measurement:** AI-driven A/B testing in HR and marketing can fine-tune processes in real time, optimizing outcomes from candidate sourcing to user engagement ([McKinsey & Company][5]).

## Looking Ahead

Cam Linke and Joshua Pantony concluded that organizations must proactively redesign their “workspace” and skill-development strategies for an AI-saturated future ([Wikipedia][8]). Embracing interdisciplinary learning, contributing to open-source AI, and integrating human-centric AI assistants will be key to thriving in the decades ahead ([boosted.ai][2]).
