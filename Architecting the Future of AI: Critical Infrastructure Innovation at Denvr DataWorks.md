## Architecting the Future of AI: Critical Infrastructure Innovation at Denvr DataWorks

Denvr DataWorks, a Calgary-based AI infrastructure specialist founded in 2017, is pioneering a new generation of data centers optimized for the immense power and water demands of AI workloads.  At this talk, Marc Kronwitt, Executive Officer at Denvr DataWorks outlined how Denvr is integrating responsible land, power, and water use from day one, deploying vertically integrated, modular data centers that achieve world-class Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and aspire to near-zero water consumption through next-gen liquid cooling.  By tailoring facility scale to AI’s unique requirements (rather than inheriting hyperscaler redundancy), leveraging Alberta’s efficient power grid and fibre networks, and innovating portable “truck-loaded” units, Denvr aims to reduce total cost of ownership, accelerate deployment cycles to six months per module, and support sovereign or on-premises AI with rigorous security and sustainability.

## 1. Environmental Footprint of AI Infrastructure

* **Global Energy Use:** In 2022, data centers worldwide consumed approximately 460 TWh of electricity, positioning them between Saudi Arabia (371 TWh) and France (463 TWh) in national comparisons ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Rising Consumption:** With AI’s explosive growth, that figure is climbing toward 900–1,000 TWh annually, up from about 470 TWh just a few years ago ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Water Stress:** Data centers now account for more than 560 billion liters of water withdrawal per year globally, with projections to exceed 1,200 billion liters by 2030, heightening concerns in water-stressed regions ([Data Center Dynamics][2]).

## 2. Designing for Sustainability

### 2.1 Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)

* **Industry Benchmarks:** State-of-the-art hyperscale sites achieve PUE as low as 1.04–1.06; average top performers hover around 1.10–1.15 ([Data Center Dynamics][3], [Google][4]).
* **Denvr’s Target:** By integrating power, cooling, and compute architecture in a single design, Denvr reports PUEs near 1.1, competing with the most efficient global operators ([REHVA][5]).

### 2.2 Water-Free Cooling Innovations

* **Next-Gen Liquid Cooling:** Single-phase immersion and emerging two-phase liquid cooling techniques can eliminate traditional evaporative towers, aiming for “zero-water AI services.”
* **Local Resources:** Leveraging Alberta’s abundant, low-carbon hydroelectric grid reduces indirect water use associated with power generation.

## 3. Vertical Integration & Sovereign AI

* **End-to-End Stack:** Denvr builds its own modular data centers, power systems, and network fabric, enabling turnkey AI services, data services, and end-user applications without third-party dependencies ([Denvr Dataworks][6]).
* **Sovereignty & Security:** On-prem or private-cloud options meet stringent regulatory or enterprise security requirements, avoiding the over-provisioning and shared-tenant risks of public hyperscalers.

---

## 4. Modular, Portable Architecture

* **Six-Month Rollouts:** A standardized, containerized module can be designed, built, and commissioned end-to-end within six months, 5× faster than conventional data-development cycles seen during COVID supply-chain bottlenecks.
* **Truck-Loadable Units:** Modules are sized to fit on standard flatbeds, supporting rapid site moves or expansions and reducing capital lock-in.

---

## 5. Business & Operational Impact

* **Cost Efficiency:** By optimizing only for AI workloads (not generic cloud redundancy), Denvr delivers lower Total Cost of Ownership and more predictable operating expenses.
* **Global Reach:** With operations worldwide, powered by partnerships and a “JEDI-like” collaboration with Microsoft for cloud services, Denvr supports AI deployments from sovereign government labs to enterprise R\&D.

## Looking Ahead

Gordon closed by reiterating that **critical infrastructure** must evolve in tandem with AI’s growth: prioritizing resource stewardship, security, and agility.  As energy and water constraints tighten, vertically integrated, modular designs, paired with advanced liquid cooling, will be essential for sustainable, sovereign AI at scale.
